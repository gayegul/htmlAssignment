Summary
I found a simple website, by googling clean websites, which belongs to a Portugese web designer. I used smashingmagazine.com, html5doctor.com, google.com, our TA Hannah's former assignment submission as a guide, and finally a software developer from Amazon.com :) to show me how to do &amp; and go over my final code for any potential dealbreaker mistakes. I also looked up the website's main source code to get the images but ended up just with one image as an example.
